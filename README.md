# Welcome
This page provides resources and information to get started programming on FIRST Robotics Competition Team 95, The Grasshoppers.

## Learning Java

We use a programming language called Java to tell the robot what to do.  

To get a quick introduction to Java, try one of the following websites.  They have some examples that can be run directly from your web browser, and thus require no special software setup.
- http://www.learnjavaonline.org/ 
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/ 

These tutorials are also useful, but require you to have Java installed on your computer.  Try them out after installing Java and Eclipse (see below).

## Getting your laptop set up

If you have a personal laptop, it's great to use it for programming the robot.  If you don't have one, you can use one of the team's laptops.

We use the following software tools:

- The Java Developer Kit (JDK)
- Eclipse, an Integrated Development Environment, to write Java code
- The WpiLib update suite, which contains a Java library that our code uses to control the robot
- SourceTree, a user interface for a Software Version Control system called git, to store our code and share it among teammates

We also sometimes use these tools:

- PuTTY, a Windows desktop client for the Secure SHell (SSH) remote access protocol, to configure and debug the robot
- FileZilla, a Windows desktop client for the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), to access files store on the robot
