# Computer Inventory
This is a place that everyone can access where we can track information about the computers we have.

Description of What We're Tracking
- Name -- what is listed in System Properties, and should also (but isn't always) on a label on the computer itself
- Location -- mainly "With the team" or "Loaned to X on xx/yy/zz" where X is a student or coach; won't necessarily try to track
- Credentials -- where username/password can be found, e.g. "On label on computer", or if they are standard, e.g. the ones on the two CTCT-17-ROBO computers, or if they are unknown (some donated computers seem to fall in this category at the moment)
- Model -- model number as printed on exterior of computer
- Specs -- basic info like processor, RAM, hard drive, and OS; e.g. Intel i5 2.6 GHz, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB drive, Windows 7 Pro
- Software -- generic description of what is installed; examples include "Fully loaded for programming 201x season", "Up-to-date with CAD as of x/y/z", "Not yet touched", etc.
- Power Supply -- power supply that works with the computer since we have lots of different ones with different shape connectors and current output
- Notes -- useful things to know like problems or quirks, e.g. "Battery basically dead; needs to be plugged in to work"
